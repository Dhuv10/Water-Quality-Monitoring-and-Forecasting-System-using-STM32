# Water-Quality-Monitoring-and-Forecasting-System-using-STM32
STM32-based water quality monitoring system with ESP32 cloud integration for real-time IoT.
ðŸ’§ STM32-Based Water Quality Monitoring and Forecasting System (IoT)

An embedded IoT system built using the **STM32F429I-DISC1** board and **ESP32 Wi-Fi module** to monitor real-time water quality parameters like pH, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), turbidity, and temperature, and send the data to a cloud dashboard for visualization and forecasting.
